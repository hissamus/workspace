Latency: "reducing the time between receiving the information and response to the information"
high throughput: the amount of the data you can process in a given amount of time.
G1 is the new low latency garbage collector planned to replace CMS in the Hotspot JVM.
The first is that G1 is a compacting collector.
 Compacting, a process by which live objects are moved over 
free memory space towards one end of the heap so that the other becomes one contiguous free area of memory

Solution: 
Don’t allocate objects needlessly
More frequent allocations means more frequent Garbage Collections

About Large objects
Expensive to allocate
Expensive to initialise

Data structure resizing
Avoid resizing of array backed “container objects”
Use the constructor that takes an explicit size parameter
Resizing leads to unnecessary object allocation
Can also contribute to fragmentation

Finalizers
Dont use them unless you really need it 
It Requires at least 2 GCs cycles and GC cycles are slower
alternative to finalizers are reference object.

Inner classes
• Have an implicit reference to the outer instance
• Can potentially increase object retention and graph
complexity
• Net affect is the potential for increased GC duration
• Thus increased latency
