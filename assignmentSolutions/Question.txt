1.Queue and Stack, which collection to use and why?

2.Read words from a file, & store words with its number of occurence in a collection Sort this in order of occurance and if frequency is same sort by word 

3.Internal working of ArrayList , LinkedListand Vector.

4.Difference and similarities in ArrayList and Vector.

5.ArrayList vs LinkedList vs HashSet

6.There's a list of integers, how to remove even nos from it and how to add more integers if there's even nos, adding elements would be 2*(even no present in list)

7.HashMap internal working. How to arrange objects in a order in a HashMap?Difference between Ordering and Sorting

8.How you will sort an arraylist based on certain fields?

9.Hashmap implementation in depth and where could we possibly use a hashmap.What would happen if we have millions of objects which return the same hashcode or retutn same index for the bucket have to be stored.Share your view on this problem.

10.What did you do to provide low latency and high throughput in your application.

11.What would you use TreeSet or HashSet and in which scenes.

12.A problem to find the character at a provided index as input.
For example ,find 15th  or ith character in the string whose blueprint is    sdsdsdsdd4xfgfgf7ghff7aqqq6gt5........to infinity.The buleprint means
that the sequence sdsdsdsdd would for example occur 4 times followed by xfgfgf which would occue for 7 times.
Here,the string is very large and need to assume that it will not throw outofmemory error.

13.HashMap Implementation and hashing techniques? Can we ensure hashCode never returns duplicate values?

14.You have 8 balls out of which 7 balls are same weight and one is heavier. How many iterations will it take to find out the heaviest?
Can you optimize the solution?

15.Write a code to find a to the power of b. Can we reduce the number of calls in the call stack of the function? How?

16.How would you control selected data from not being updated before you update it and commit into DB.Basically,how would you control concurrent database access for your jdbc application.

17.List<Object> l = new ArrayList<String>();

18.hashcode & equals, consequences

19.significance of loadfactor

20.What do you mean by fail-fast?Which Collection classes are failfast.

21.Difference between hashSet and hashmap.

22.ArrayList V/s LinkedList.When arraylist increases it's size and by how much?

23.Hashing Technique
